# SDP Telescope Computing Drone GUI (Work in Progress)

Welcome to the SDP Telescope Computing Drone GUI project! This repository houses the graphical user interface (GUI) for our SDP for NASAMINDS designed to work in conjunction with a telescope-mounted computing drone. Please note that this project is currently a work in progress, and we are actively developing and enhancing its features.

## Overview

The SDP Telescope Computing Drone GUI is being created to streamline and simplify the control and data visualization processes for the telescope-mounted computing drone. It aims to provide an intuitive interface for interacting with the drone and accessing the data collected during observations.

## Dependencies 

- PySide6 'pip install pyside6'
- qdarktheme 'pip install pyqtdarktheme'

## Direction  - For the team taking over
